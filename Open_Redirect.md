# Open Redirect Summary

"Open Redirect" or "Unvalidated Redirection" is possible when a web application accepts untrusted input that could cause the web application to redirect the request to a URL contained within untrusted input. By modifying untrusted URL input to a malicious site, an attacker may successfully launch a phishing attack and steal user credentials.

Open Redirection is itself a minor vulnerability, but, it thus itself can cause major damage to the web-application when integrated with others as with "RCE" or "XSS".

### Basic Redirection
There are chances when the developer does not care about the input validations or filtrations or anything specific and simply implements the redirection functions as header() and let the redirected URL be in the clear texts.
```php
<?php
header('Location'.($_GET["url"]));
die();
?>
```
So we can manipulate the request to change the URL parameter, like:

/page.php?**url=redirect.com**

### Enconded Redirection

URL Encoding is one of the most common encoding methodologies that the developer use in order to disallow some vulnerable characters such as "<" or ">", to get embedded into the URL.

```php
<?php
header('Location'.urldecode($_GET["url"]));
die();
?>
```
This can be bypassed using a simple URL encoder, like Burp suite.
### DOM-based Open Redirect
DOM-based open-redirection vulnerabilities arise when a script writes attacker-controllable data into a sink that can trigger cross-domain navigation which thus facilitates phishing attacks against users of the websites.
A sink is a potentially dangerous JavaScript function or DOM object that can cause undesirable effects if attacker-controlled data is passed to it.
The major sinks that could lead to DOM-based Open Redirection vulnerability are:

"location"; "location.hostname"; "location.href"; "location.pathname".
