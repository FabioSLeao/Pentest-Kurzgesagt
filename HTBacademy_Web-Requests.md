# HTB-Academy -- Web Requests
[HTTP](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616) is an application-level protocol used to access resources over the World Wide Web. The term `hypertext` stands for text containing links to other resources and text that can be easily interpreted by the readers.

HTTP communication consists of a client and a server, where the client requests the server for a resource. The server processes the requests and returns the requested resource. The default port for HTTP communication is 80; however, this can be changed.
### HTTP Methods
| Method | Description
|--------|----------
|GET|This is the most common HTTP method, which requests a specific resource. Additional data can be passed to the server via query strings.
|POST|This is another common method used to send data to the server. It can handle multiple types of input, such as text, PDFs, and other forms of binary data. This data is appended in the request body present after the headers. The POST method is commonly used when sending information (forms, logins) or uploading data to a website, such as images or documents.
|HEAD|This method requests the headers that would be returned if a GET request was made to the server. It doesn't return the request body and is usually made to check the response length before downloading resources.
|PUT|This method is similar to POST, as it's used to create new resources on the server. Allowing this method without proper controls can lead to the addition of malicious resources (i.e., uploading a malicious file to the webserver).
|OPTIONS| The `OPTIONS` method is useful to enumerate the list of methods allowed by the server. This can help us plan the further set of actions we can use to attack the webserver.

### Responses Codes
|Type|Description
-------|---------
|1xx|Usually provides information and continues processing the request.
|2xx|Positive response codes returned when a request succeeds.
|3xx|Returned when the server redirects the client.
|4xx|This class of codes signifies improper requests from the client. For example, requesting a resource that doesn't exist or requesting a bad format.
|5xx|Returned when there is some problem with the HTTP server itself.
