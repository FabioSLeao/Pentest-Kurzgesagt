# Introduction to Web Applications
### Attacking Web Applications
*"In this day and age most every company, no matter the size has one or more web applications within their external perimeter. These applications can be everything from simple static websites to blogs powered by Content Management Systems (CMS) such as WordPress to complicated applications with sign-up/login functionality supporting various user roles from basic users to super admins.   
In my experience, it is not uncommon to find flaws that can lead directly to code execution, such as a file upload form that allows for the upload of malicious code or a file inclusion vulnerability that can be leveraged to obtain remote code execution. A well-known vulnerability that is still quite prevalent in various types of web applications is SQL injection. This type of vulnerability arises from the unsafe handling of user-supplied input. It can result in access to sensitive data, reading/writing files on the database server, and even remote code execution.  
We often find SQL injection vulnerabilities on web applications that use Active Directory for authentication. While we can usually not leverage this to extract passwords (since Active Directory administers them), we can often pull most or all Active Directory user email addresses, which are often the same as their usernames. This data can then be used to perform a password spraying attack against web portals that use Active Directory for authentication such as VPN or Microsoft Outlook Web Access/Microsoft O365. A successful password spray can often result in access to sensitive data such as email or even a foothold directly into the corporate network environment.  
A few more real-world examples of web application attacks and the impact are as follows:"*
|Flaw|Real-World scenario|
------|------------------
[SQL injection](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/SQL_Injection)|Obtaining Active Directory usernames and performing a password spraying attack against a VPN or email portal.
|[File Inclusion](https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/latest/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/07-Input_Validation_Testing/11.1-Testing_for_Local_File_Inclusion)|Reading source code to find a hidden page or directory which exposes additional functionality that can be used to gain remote code execution.
[Unrestricted File Upload](https://owasp.org/www-community/vulnerabilities/Unrestricted_File_Upload)|A web application that allows a user to upload a profile picture that allows any file type to be uploaded (not just images). This can be leveraged to gain full control of the web application server by uploading malicious code.
|[Indirect Object Reference (IDOR)](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Insecure_Direct_Object_Reference_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html)|When combined with a flaw such as broken access control, this can often be used to access another user's files or functionality. An example would be editing your user profile browsing to a page such as /user/ 701/edit-profile. If we can change the `701` to `702`, we may edit another user's profile!
[Broken Access Control](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/2017/A5_2017-Broken_Access_Control)|Another example is an application that allows a user to register a new account. If the account registration functionality is designed poorly, a user may perform privilege escalation when registering. Consider the `POST` request when registering a new user, which submits the data `username=bjones&password=Welcome1&email=bjones@inlanefreight.local&roleid=3`. What if we can manipulate the `roleid` parameter and change it to `0` or `1`. We have seen real-world applications where this was the case, and it was possible to quickly register an admin user and access many unintended features of the web application.
### Front-End Vulnerabilities
##### Sensitive Data Exposure
*[Sensitive Data Exposure](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/2017/A3_2017-Sensitive_Data_Exposure) refers to the availability of sensitive data in clear-text to the end-user. This is usually found in the `source code` of the web page or page source on the front end of web applications.*
#### HTML Injection
